This program models aspects of a stellar accretion disk winds, computing the cylindrical radius on a grid, the mass-loss rate as a function of w, and the wind's azimuthal velocity component, assuming conservation of angular momentum. The equation has been modified to assume some constant properities. Documentation of this will be written later.

**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AS OF THIS NOTE**
