This program is designed to calculate various physical parameters related to the structure and dynamics of an accretion disk and its associated wind in an astrophysical context. Specifically, it includes functions to:

Compute the cylindrical radius (w) within the accretion disk, which is a measure of distance from the central object (such as a star or black hole) in the disk's mid-plane.

Determine the mass-loss rate from the accretion disk as a function of w, based on a power-law relationship that correlates with the disk's mid-plane temperature.
