# Coordinate System and Stellar Wind Simulation

This Python script defines a 3D coordinate system and performs a simulation of stellar wind, calculating the wind density, velocity, and temperature. The results are saved to CSV files.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- NumPy

## Output

The script will perform the simulation and save the results to the following CSV files:

1. `wind_density_output.csv`: Contains the calculated wind density.
2. `wind_output.csv`: Contains the calculated wind velocity.
3. `temp0_output.csv`: Contains the calculated temperature.

## Functions

The script contains several functions:

- `coordinate_system()`: Defines a 3D coordinate system.
- `calculate_angle()`: Calculates the angle between the plane and the z-axis.
- `calculate_mass_loss_rate()`: Calculates the rate of mass loss from the star.
- `get_source_point()`: Calculates the distance from the source point to a point in the coordinate system.
- `calculate_vp()`: Calculates the velocity of the stellar wind.
- `wind_density()`: Calculates the density of the stellar wind.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to catch and print any exceptions that occur during the simulation.
