# RADMC3D Property Files
These files are essential for the proper functioning of RADMC3D. If you've already compiled RADMC3D, these files should exist in your system. They are included here to highlight their importance in the calculations.

If you are interested in implementing H2 emission into your model, rather than the traditional CO emission, you can copy-paste the "test_h2" folder into the RADMC examples folder and run through the procedures as you usually would.
